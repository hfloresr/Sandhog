## Project Summary

The goal of our project remains the same: to design and implement a learning algorithm that trains an agent to collaborate with another (human or non-human) AI to catch a pig in Minecraft according to the rules of The Malmo Collaborative AI Challenge. 

## Approach

Give a detailed description of your approach, in a few paragraphs. You should summarize the
main algorithm you are using, such as by writing out the update equation (even if it is off-the-shelf). You
should also give details about the approach as it applies to your scenario. For example, if you are using
reinforcement learning for a given scenario, describe the MDP in detail, i.e. how many states/actions you
have, what does the reward function look like. A good guideline is to incorporate sufficient details so that
most of your approach is reproducible by a reader. I encourage you to use figures, as appropriate, for this,
as I provided in the writeup for the first assignment (available here: http://sameersingh.org/courses/
aiproj/sp17/assignments.html#assignment1). I recommend at least 2-3 paragraphs.

## Evaluation

An important aspect of your project, as we mentioned in the beginning, is evaluating your
project. Be clear and precise about describing the evaluation setup, for both quantitative and qualitative
results. Present the results to convince the reader that you have a working implementation. Use plots, charts,
tables, screenshots, figures, etc. as needed. I expect you will need at least a few paragraphs to describe each
type of evaluation that you perform.

## Remaining Goals and Challenges

In a few paragraphs, describe your goals for the next 2-3 weeks, when
the final report is due. At the very least, describe how you consider your prototype to be limited, and what
you want to add to make it a complete contribution. Note that if you think your algorithm is quite good,
but have not performed sufficient evaluation, doing them can also be a reasonable goal. Similarly, you may
propose some baselines (such as a hand-coded policy) that you did not get a chance to implement, but
want to compare against for the final submission. Finally, given your experience so far, describe some of the
challenges you anticipate facing by the time your final report is due, how crippling you think it might be,
and what you might do to solve them.
